# PetalMenu
A flowering menu built with SwiftUI. 

Using .rotationEffect and a .bouncy animation, PetalMenu expands and collapses to provide users a unique way to make a selection.

In this sample app, PetalMenu is used as a theme picker. It takes a @Binding to a selectedColor value, and ContentView renders a backgroundGradient based on the selection. The ColorPalette object provides arrays of Color in multicolor, warm, cool, and monochromatic styles.
